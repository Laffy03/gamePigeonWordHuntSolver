Installation Instructions:

Start by navigating to the "Releases" tab in GitHub (located right below "About")

1. Download the `.zip` file
2. Extract all files
3. Run `gamePigeonWordHuntSolver.exe`
4. If Windows Security shows a warning, click "More Info" then "Run Anyway"
    - *This appears because I don't have a Windows code signing certificate yet*
  
Unfortunately MacOS/Linux users are out of luck, this release is windows exclusive :(
